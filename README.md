# OS Code Dump

This is a repository containing code dumps of the Operating Systems (OS) coursework for B. Tech. (IT) Second Year at the Symbiosis Institute of Technology, Pune.

## Directories
The dump is organised into 3 directories.

### `main`
Contains highly optimised and robust code, and makes use of concepts not yet done in class.

### `simplified`
Contains unoptimised and fragile code, but sticks to concepts duly covered in class.

### `deprecated`
Contains older code that has since been modified to add optimisations and robustness. The modified code is in the `main` directory.
